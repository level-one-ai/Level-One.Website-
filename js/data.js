          <h3>What We Analyze</h3>
          <p>Our audit examines your complete workflow from lead capture through service delivery. We track time spent on repetitive tasks, measure conversion leakage, and calculate opportunity costs of manual bottlenecks.</p>
          <p>Every process receives an automation score based on repetition frequency, time consumption, error rate, and strategic importance. High-scoring processes become immediate deployment candidates.</p>
          
          <h3>Deliverables</h3>
          <p>You receive a comprehensive audit documenting current state costs (labor hours, opportunity cost, error correction) and projected state economics (infrastructure investment, ongoing costs, efficiency gains).</p>
          <p>Each recommendation includes specific ROI projections, implementation timeline, and resource requirements—enabling data-driven infrastructure decisions.</p>
          
          <h3>Timeline</h3>

          <h3>Implementation Approach</h3>
          <p>Deployment follows a phased methodology prioritizing highest-ROI infrastructure first. Initial implementations generate quick wins—building organizational momentum and funding subsequent phases.</p>
          <p>Each system receives comprehensive testing before handover. We verify accuracy, measure performance against baseline, and ensure integration with existing tools functions correctly.</p>
